After traveling hundreds of miles on foot, a group of five Venezuelans, who together call themselves a family, arrived in Medell√≠n on February 27th. Before leaving their homes, they all held different, honest jobs including food service and hair care but were all laid off over the course of the last year due to a crumbling economy.
