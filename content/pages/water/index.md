Mordy Mis, 26, stands on the shore of Tom Owens Caye, a one-acre island halfway between the shores of Belize and Honduras. On a clear day he can see 25 miles, to the ridgeline of the Maya Mountains, Central America’s highest peaks. Most days, though, he is surrounded only by open ocean, silver and blue waves stretching endlessly in every direction.

In the tidepool at his feet, two nurse sharks, the Carribean’s most docile predators, are circling the carcass of a lionfish. Mordy snaps a picture, records a video, and watches the sharks with a knowing smile.

“I take videos for my daughter, to show and document these things,” he says. “She looks forward to when I come home and show her something beautiful like this.”

He looks back out to the sea, where thousands of corals sit silently beneath the clear water.

“My greatest fear,” he says, “is that one day these things, this beauty, will be only a distant memory. I don’t want these videos to be her only memory of this place. My baby is not the only baby in the world. A whole generation could grow up never seeing the places that I love.”

Mordy lives on the caye during the week, where he works as the island supervisor for Reef Conservation Initiative, a nonprofit that surveys Belize’s coral reef and promotes conservation. On the weekends, he travels home to his village in mainland Belize, a journey that takes him more than 6(fc) hours when weather conditions are good.

ReefCI, as it’s known, is one of a number of coral protection nonprofits that have launched in Belize in the last three decades, a response to one of the world’s quietest ecological disasters.

All along the rest of Belize’s 200 miles of coral reef, a species is being suffocated. Climate change has warmed the country’s tropical seas more than 2 degrees Celsius since 1980 [how does that compare to global average?], and much of the reef has become diseased or stressed to the point of bleaching, an effect that turns the vibrant living invertebrates into stark white skeletons. Coral mortality has increased over 40% since 2006, and without significant intervention, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) projects that the reef will be almost entirely gone by 2050.

Corals are a remarkably sophisticated and misunderstood creature, as vital to the sea as trees are to dry land. A coral is not one animal, but a collective structure of thousands, sometimes even millions of tiny animals known as polyps, which are fully functioning organisms with a mouth and stomach. Polyps evolved to absorb dissolved minerals in the water, which they convert to calcium carbonate, or limestone. The polyps use these minerals to build skeletal structures as complex as any built by people, from great branching fan corals to strong and sturdy elk and staghorn acropora. Their structures can grow to the size of houses and some reefs can stretch for hundreds of miles. They are found in warm waters all over the world.

Polyps are remarkable for their “hive mind,” a kind of animal intelligence that allows all the polyps of a single coral to act and respond as one organism. The genetic code embedded within polyps instructs them to build their elaborate skeletons and grow in efficient patterns that are beneficial to their survival.

But corals are delicate, stationary animals, qualities that make them highly sensitive to the rapid environmental changes happening in Belize and around the world.

Dr. Karl Castillo (age) is a marine science researcher specializing in coral ecology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Castillo was born in Belize, and spent much of his early career studying the Belize coral reef system.

“When we think of climate change in regards to coral,” he says, “we are looking at rising ocean temperatures and ocean acidification, as well as [...] other factors like storms and precipitation.”


Castillo studies how different species of coral adapt to changes in their environment. As humans release carbon into the atmosphere and trap heat, the oceans absorb the majority of those rising temperatures. Coral has evolved to survive within very specific temperature ranges, usually between 22 and 26 degrees Celsius (72 to 78 degrees F), so that even a small change in temperature can send the animal into thermal distress.

Bleaching, which kills corals at the highest rate among all the species’ active threats, occurs when polyps attempt to conserve energy by expelling the algae within their bodies that acts as their food source. This is a stress response that leaves the coral a striking white with only the skeleton exposed. While some coral can recover after a bleaching event, most often bleaching is an omen of imminent death.

Climate change, coupled with a huge increase in nitrates from agricultural runoff from farms on the mainland, also makes ocean water more acidic. Just as corals need specific temperatures to thrive, they also require a specific level of acidity. Rapid changes in nitrate levels cause corals to stop growing or even lose their structural integrity. In extremely acidic waters, such as those along the northern shore of Jamaica, large patches of coral have disintegrated.

Both the warming of the sea and its increasing acidity allow previously niche coral diseases to thrive and spread over massive distances. Maladies like stony coral tissue loss disease, white band disease and red band disease are killing coral at higher rates than ever before (add real statistic). Stony coral tissue loss migrated with record speed, first appearing in the Florida Keys in November 2018. The latest coral disease research suggests that it has reached as far as the Cozumel region of Mexico, but by the time we were reporting in the country in March 2020, coral volunteers reported that stony coral tissue loss was already causing problems in southern Belize.

“Belize has been quite lucky in some ways,” says Dr. Castillo, “that despite how quickly we are losing some of these coral species, the country has managed to avoid major storms for almost 20 years.”

Another hallmark of climate change is an increased frequency of severe storms like hurricanes. The eastern United States has seen some of the worst of this environmental threat in recent years, but Belize has only had one major hurricane in the last three decades, a Category 4 storm called Iris in October 2001. Iris devastated much of the Caribbean region, and nearly leveled the small town of Placencia, where Barriers was based this year. In the 19 years since, developers from around the world have invested heavily in Belize, transforming the very infrastructure of the region into a tourism haven.
Now, 800-foot cruise liners release tons of food and fuel waste into the waters, stirring up sand from the seafloor and suffocating the coral. Five star resorts have been built on islands that have never been inhabited by humans before, and small cayes are being expanded by dredging sand and soil from the surrounding waters, often decimating entire sections of coral reef.

So what happens when coral dies? Coral are what ecologists call a keystone species, meaning that they are vital to the survival of an entire ecosystem; if coral disappears, so goes the majority of marine life in the Caribbean. For some fish, like the blank, corals are a source of food. For so many others, including the blank and the blankfish, corals provide much needed shelter from sunlight and predators. Many species will make life-long homes in one coral, going out only to find food or a mate.

Reefs can be thought of like cities, with fish, sea turtles, crustaceans, stingrays, zooplankton and everything in between acting as the population, where the coral animals act as the buildings, roads and public spaces.

“We can see in reefs that have already been destroyed, like in parts of Florida, that when the coral has died, the wildlife does not return,” says Castillo. “This in itself is a problem, where many species simply die, but those that survive move to another part of the ocean and create imbalances in the ecosystem.”

## Can you regrow coral? What are the possible solutions? Nonprofits

Lisa Carne has been trying to tell the world what is happening to coral in Belize for 25 years. The world, for the most part, has not listened. “The ecosystem we are trying to save is what keeps this country alive,” said Carne.

Carne is a figure of mythic proportion in southern Belize. In Placencia, locals know her for more than just her work. She is famous for driving a bright orange pick-up truck with her nonprofit’s logo branded on the driver’s side door. Carne moved to Placencia from California in 1995 to work as a research assistant for the Smithsonian Institute. It was later that year that Belize saw its first mass coral bleaching event in history. She was still a young and freshly relocated biologist when Hurricane Iris devastated hundreds of coastal communities on and around the Placencia peninsula. The lack of care and concern for the coral reef after the event made Carne wonder: can we regrow this essential part of our ecosystem?

 “I wanted to spend my life in the water, working in the field,” said Carne. “I started out down in the reef by myself, recording data and running experiments on coral regeneration.”

The removal of living coral fragments to use as seeds for a new coral organism, also known as coral regeneration or coral farming, is all the rage in marine ecology today.

“It’s like yoga,” says Carne, “everybody is trying to do it but most people aren’t very good at it.”

But in 2005, it was still a real novelty. Scientists knew that it was possible to regrow coral and had ‘farmed’ the animals in labs for several years, but no one had ever put those methods to the test where they were most needed: the ocean floor.

Carne, through dozens of trial-and-error experiments on real Belizean corals, learned that not only was it possible to regrow coral, it could be done on a massive scale. She discovered that acropora corals, what most people call staghorn and elkhorn, are the most receptive to regeneration if they are ‘planted’ in a different part of a reef system. She even experimented with them by crossbreeding the two and creating the world’s first hybrid species of coral.

In 2006, Carne put a public face to her work by founding Fragments of Hope, a nonprofit created to restore the coral reef in Belize and advocate for greater awareness and protection of the species who call it home. She is Fragments of Hope's only full-time employee, but she has worked with dozens of local volunteers who are passionate about conserving the reef.

Victor Faux (age) is one of three volunteers currently working with Fragments of Hope. He helped explain how the nonprofit regrows coral, as well as works to change hearts and minds about conservation in Belize.

“When Lisa first started out, she was using Laughing Bird Caye as a kind of laboratory,” he says. “And Laughing Bird is where we have really seen the coral flourish. We’ve done two kinds of work there. It’s outplanting, where we take bigger coral pieces we have grown and start to build the reef back up again, and then it’s the nurseries, where we grow the coral from micro fragments.”

The nurseries look more like underwater cage match scenes than places that could foster new life, but they are more effective and cost-efficient than any laboratory on land. They are rudimentary cubes about ten feet across, made of steel rebar cross-hatched with ropes (fact check). The coral fragments are embedded into the fibers of the rope, where the animal’s skeleton has space and protection to spread out and take root. Some fragments are carefully sutured to little round dabs of concrete, dubbed ‘cookies’ in the Fragments of Hope lexicon, while others are placed on temporary trays.

“It’s the outplanting that really amazes people who come see our work,” said Faux.

Laughing Bird Caye is just a little bigger than Tom Owens with even less infrastructure. It is among the most well preserved Marine Protection Areas (MPA) in Belize, and it is co-managed, like all MPAs, by the Belizean government and a nonprofit organization. Off the east-facing beach of the caye, coral fields the size of soccer pitches are thriving, made up entirely of coral regrown by Fragments of Hope volunteers.

A practiced eye can tell it from a naturally occurring reef--a little heavy on the acropora and chimney corals, a little light on the soft corals and fan corals--but to the casual observer it appears to be one of the healthiest ecosystems in the region.

“I say ‘seeing is Beliz-ing,’” said Carne, “ because you have no idea how far we’ve come and how effective our work has been until you go down in the water and look at it for yourself.”

Fragments of Hope volunteers only spend a few days per year in the water, mostly surveying the progress of existing outplants when water and weather conditions are at their best. Most of the work Lisa Carne organizes is community outreach. At various spots on the Placencia peninsula and scattered around the cayes, signs that read “More Corals = More Fish” are posted, on supermarket walls, boat docks, and the outside bars and restaurants tourists frequent.

“If we can make people connect the health of the reef to their daily lives, you might actually make some progress,” says Carne.

Fragments of Hope frequently visits schools and leads free snorkeling expeditions for students, hoping that an interested few will pursue careers in conservation, and that the rest will take home the message to their families, many of whom work in industries like fishing and tourism, which rely on a healthy coral reef to survive.

Fragments of Hope is part of a larger network of environmental nonprofits that operate throughout Belize. ReefCI, where Mordy Mis works as a supervisor on Tom Owens Caye, has been unable to secure a license to do coral regeneration, but instead provides valuable survey data on the health of the reef and essential services like the management of invasive lionfish. Fragments of Hope and ReefCI are the only two nonprofits in Belize who are primarily focused on the reef, but other organizations like the Southern Environmental Association (SEA) and Oceania of Belize do valuable outreach with Belizean youth and important conservation work centred around the declining health of the country’s corals.

## Next Generation, Mindset Shift, Focus on Short-Sightedness as the Central Problem
Everyone is tied together through outreach and finding hope in a younger generation. Ask the question: what is it that makes us so short-sighted about this issue? It boggles the mind. The only solution possible is a mindset shift that may take more time than we have.

“When it comes to climate change, everyone wants a nice, clean story with a happy ending,” said Lisa Carne. “This just isn’t that story.”
