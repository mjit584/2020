Nestled inside the lush green forest of coastal Belize, the dozens of green and red cocoa pods grow.
These pods have been growing in this area since 1800 BC, when the Mayans first discovered they could turn them into a rich drink.

The pods start out as small white flowers smaller than a pinky finger, and they are pollinated by insects so small they can hardly be seen with the human eye. After more than three years these flowers grow into oblong pods roughly the size of cantaloupes. As soon as they start to show hints of gold, the are harvested with sticks or twisted off by hand. If cut with a machete, the flowers would not be able to regrow back in the same location. The farmer, Narcisso, plucks one off and breaks it in half, revealing the white seeds inside.  These slimy wet beans have a citrus-y sweet flavor, more akin to an orange than a bar of chocolate.  
These farmers harvests once every ten days for six months, but in the off days and months the groves must be constantly maintained to stave off pests and disease and make sure the pods are getting the optimal amount of shade.
Narcisso’s brother, Julio Saqui, takes the beans from his brother’s farm and uses them to create fine chocolate.

His storefront is a square concrete box, emblazoned with Che’il (meaning wild) Mayan Chocolate, with walls painted the same green as trees outside, and floors a rich orange clay. Local art from village members sits on shelves next to a corner refrigerator, which hold the result of a 21-day process of plucking, drying, fermenting, drying, roasting, crushing and grinding of the beans, wrapped in foil.

Saqui’s  largest competitor is Maya Mountain Cacao, created and majority-owned by the Berkeley, California-based company Uncommon Cacao. This year, the company plans to source 65 metric tons of cocao beans, General Manager Roxanna Chen said, up from 47 last year.  
Demand for fine chocolate, such as the “bean to bar” variety Uncommon produces, has exploded in the US in recent years. Sales of premium chocolate grew 19 percent in 2018, according to the Fine Chocolate Industry Association, compared to 0.6 percent growth in the mainstream chocolate industry.

“When we pay less than $2 for a chocolate bar, we are paying for the systemic poverty of millions of families,” Uncommon founder said during a July 2017 presentation at the U.S. Institute of Peace. The company charges $TK for its bars.

But these profits haven’t seemed to trickle down to small Belizean farmers. Maya Mountain only pays each of its 308 registered farmers an average of $309 a year.

For their hours of toil, farmers like Narcisso make only 70 cents to $1.50 per pound of wet beans they harvest. Most farmers are forced to supplement their income by growing other crops such as maize or bananas, or by offering tours to outsiders.

“I want the small farmer to know that his work is important,” Saqui said. “I want him to know that he is an integral part of the success of what we do.”
Poverty in Belize is not unique to farmers. More than 40 percent of Belizeans live below the poverty line according to the World Bank. 13.9 percent of the country makes less than $2 a day.
Agriculture now makes up more than 10 percent of both Belize’s GDP and Labor Force, according to the CIA Factbook.

“It's very worrisome,” Julio tells us. “These people are totally dependent on not only on the Toledo Growers Association, to buy the beans from them, but also to offer technical support.

Colorfully-painted churches lined the sides of the roads, juxtaposed next to thatched roof Mayan homes.

Despite the threat from pests like squirrels and birds and diseases, Saqui insists that his beans be grown without the use of pesticides.


But what the big farmers and buyers are doing is that they're paying this farmer, a very small amount of money so that he gets disappointed, he lose interest. And the next best thing for him to do now is to sell his land to the bigger farmer or a buyer so that then that we can, they can harvest everything you've done so they pay a little bit of money and that's it for you. You still make a loss, but for them they will make more by selling more of the crops that keeps coming from the farm.”

Despite the rapid growth of the cocao industry in Belize, the government is doing little to none to supports growers and producers.
We have started noticing it about three years ago but never never did it in the expand because there was the the association was trying to actually control it. But like I was telling him the association just fell apart. Oh, growers. Yeah. And that then quotes the administration arm that is offering technical support to the salon story. That's a long story but what happened was that Green and Black used to support the association. They actually give them financial support. Green and blacks green and blacks. We named blacks a branch of branch of them. Was it is it, Hershey's, I think it's good in blacks and technical support with the branched off from conventional cocao to fully organically grown cows.
