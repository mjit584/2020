Welcome to the Belize 2020 Github Repo!  

The site is built in HUGO Static Site Generator
https://gohugo.io/

We will store our Hugo source files here.  Upon merge to master, webhooks will be set up to automatically deploy the site to the CloudApps container.  This pushes the /pubic directory only.
