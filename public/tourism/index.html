  <section class="story-content">
    <p>It’s 6 a.m. in Monkey River, a village in southern Belize, and not many people are awake. It’s mostly just roosters and tour guides, who are getting their boats ready to go to Placencia, a tourist destination 40 minutes north of this small, quiet community.</p>
<p>The guides will pick up tourists there and take them back to Monkey River, as they’ve done for at least 20 years.</p>
<div id="video-top"></div>
<div class="video-container">

 </div>
<p>Terry Garbutt, a 43-year-old local guide, hops into his 10-passenger boat and leaves the dock. It’s hot and it’s not raining, so tours will be in high demand. Garbutt has nearly a dozen tourists waiting for him in Placencia.</p>
<p>On his way to town, he passes a small but luxurious island known as Harvest Caye. Ten  years ago, Harvest Caye was only a piece of land covered with dense vegetation. Nothing  but birds and other animals existed there . In November 2016, it became Belize’s newest cruise port, owned exclusively by Norwegian Cruise Lines.</p>
<p>Norwegian’s ships, which passenger capacity varies between 2,000 and 4,200, stop at the key almost every day. Up to 4 cruises per day or 13 per week. The big ship will dock just off the island, and passengers who would like to spend a few hours there can get on a smaller boat that ferries them to shore.</p>
<p>The private resort offers bars, a shopping area, a 15,000-square-foot swimming pool, a nature park and different activities such as ziplining, kayaking, and paddle boarding.</p>
<p>“We are delighted to welcome our first guests today,” said Norwegian President and Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio at the resort’s grand opening. “We have worked closely with the government of Belize to ensure that this spectacular destination was authentic for our guests.”</p>
<p>However, not everyone shared Del Rio’s enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“Do you see the lighthouse over there?” Terry sometimes asks his passengers during the tour, pointing at the only tower on this seven-acre island. “It’s actually not even real, it’s just decoration.” He laughs with a bit of sarcasm, but then gets quiet.</p>
<p>Terry never really thought this multi-million dollar project was a good idea, in fact, he still doesn’t; many of his friends and coworkers in Monkey River share the same feeling.</p>
<p>“We're not getting anything from the cruise ship,” said Terry. “They're not using much of the local guides. So it's a waste of time for us in southern Belize”.</p>
<p>Local tour guides not being employed by the cruise ship company, or not getting any benefits from it at all, is certainly one of the main reasons why this industry causes so much controversy. “We kind of put up with it because we thought it would have been bringing jobs to the area, you know, but after it comes by now, no one's getting much from it,” added Terry.</p>
<p>Certain environmental impacts are also under discussion. One important part of the experience on these immense floating cities includes taking a “break from the break” and touring around the most attractive areas of Belize. Villagers from Monkey River complain that the boats run by cruise line tour guides are overloading the river, damaging the environment, and  exacerbating what is probably the village's main issue: coastal erosion.</p>
<p>“Cruise tourism really started to affect us. Too much traffic on the river, you don't see as much as you used to. And it is also eroding away the river bank. They have big boats, 35 40 footer, and they go really fast,” explained Terry’s brother Jeremy, who also works as a tour guide.</p>
<p>“It’s the bigger boats that pull the bigger waves and the guys run them pretty hard. It creates a lot more erosion than our smaller boats. We do have a river fluctuation. So we get natural erosion as well. But definitely those are showing a big impact up there,” furthered Terry.</p>
<p>Monkey River has been struggling with coastal erosion since the mid-1980s, according to research done by (&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;..). It’s hard for locals to remember exactly when the erosion became a real problem, but it is easy to point out the damages it has caused. Coastal retreat has led to the loss of a soccer field, the sandy beach, lots of land and houses, and the community’s cemetery.</p>
<p>“There's been a lot of beach that went away. Where that cemetery was, that was so far back into the jungle when I was a kid. I never believed that we would have had some tombs washing in the ocean right now,” said Terry.</p>
<p>Cruise ships are certainly one of the most important components of Belize’s economy. With more than 300 ships and more than 1 million passengers arriving each year, the cruise ship industry has contributed positively to national economic growth. However, there are always two sides to every story, and many Belizeans believe that cruises pose many concerns related to sociocultural and environmental impact such as low participation of local citizens in the industry and the flora and fauna’s deterioration in the destinations frequented by cruise tourists.</p>
<p>“We really don't care for the cruise line to be over here at all. They want to make all the money from their guests, and the locals make nothing at all,” said Jeremy.</p>
<p>“Dear Mr. Del Río…”<br />
In xxxx a letter was written by the Monkey River Village Council. Frank Del Rio, Norwegian President and Chief Executive Officer, was the chosen audience.</p>
<p>“I write to draw attention to the negative environmental and social impact that Norwegian Cruise Lines is having on the Monkey River environment and community in Southern Belize and to request you to take urgent remedial action. This is an unfortunate case of a cruise line providing no economic benefit to a community but only causing environmental damage.”</p>
<p>So begins this petition that in eight paragraphs, and with the support of many of the locals’ signatures, tries to summarize and bring almost 4 years of disagreements to an end. However, the petition was never sent. The signature of the village’s mayor was missing. He has a different opinion about the cruise industry, and the blank space above the “Chairman Monkey River Village council” made it clear.</p>
<p>“We really can’t stop cruise ships, so I think the only thing we could do is work with them and try to benefit from them,” said Leonardo Castro, the village's mayor.</p>
<p>But who is really benefiting? “Just three guys from the village are working for the cruise line,” clarified Jeremy. “The tour operator (&hellip;) and two other local guys employed with him. So just three guys are making any money from the Norwegian Cruise Line.”</p>
<h2 id="petition">Petition</h2>
<p>When Terry or his brother Jeremy go up the river and show the tourists the wildlife around the area, the environment and the experience on the boat is not as it used to be five years ago.</p>
<p>“The cruise ship people, they are using bigger boats. A lot of people in those boats,” Terry explained. “Also we're selling [the tours] at the same hour, so all the boats are hitting [on the water at the same time, which makes it less fortunate for you to find all these crocodiles, and stuff that you're looking, for being behind these big bigger boats. They drink bigger waves, they erode more of the banks of the river as well. So definitely it's hard to work together and knowing that you're not getting anything from the cruise line, that's even worse.”</p>
<p>As part of the tour, Terry and Jeremy would bring their passengers back to Monkey River around 1 p.m. to have lunch, let them explore the village, and maybe buy a small souvenir. “To make a little something you know, try to keep the village upgrade a little bit,” as Terry would say. But since the guides working for the cruise line also have their own tours, things have changed a little, and local stores aren’t prospering from the cruise tourists.</p>
<p>“If we would get a benefit from the cruise line, the boats that work for them would come on shore, buy a little gift, a little drink, snack or something. Everybody could get a benefit. But they don't do that,” explained Ivan [last name], who was the village's mayor from 2017 to 2019. Terry reinforced this concern.</p>
<p>“We had a petition signed. It was in black and white. We probably need the people from NCL to come in and see what's going on because it's been throwing all these impacts without any benefits. So we hope that we could get it clear up peacefully.”</p>
<p>Anchored in  conflict for years<br />
The agreement signed in 2013 between the government of Belize and Norwegian granted the cruise line a 25-year concession designating it as the only cruise port in the southern Belize.</p>
<p>Many people who live near the key didn’t really understand what the presence of this Miami-based cruise line would entail. All kinds of questions and concerns started to arise.</p>
<p>“There was one guy that worked for the cruise line and walked around in the village talking about cruise tourism,” said Terry. “A lot of people didn't know much about cruise tourism at that point.”</p>
<p>“We had several stakeholder consultations at the time. And a lot of those concerns were then reflected in the management of the agreement,”said Noriko Gamero, Director of Destination Planning and Cruise at Belize Tourism Board. “So all of those comments were taken into consideration”.</p>
<p>However, people weren’t satisfied with the answers coming from the cruise line. Not a lot of time passed before they started to oppose the idea of ​​a private cruise port in southern Belize. Tour guides, tourism stakeholders, members and representatives of different organizations such as the Belize Tourism Industry Association (BTIA) and the Federation of Cruise Tourism Associations of Belize (FCTAB) were some of them.</p>
<p>“B.T.I.A. not in support of NCL project”, “BTIA says no to proposed cruise port in Southern Belize” were some of the headlines in the newspapers  in August and September 2013.</p>
<p>“Actually, before they started all that, people went to a voting. Pretty much all of southern Belize voted against the Norwegian Cruise Line,” said Jeremy.</p>
<p>“I voted against it,” he stressed, so there wouldn't be any doubts.</p>
<p>In September 2010, the Belize Tourism Board contracted Seatone Consulting to carry out an independent assessment to determine whether or not people in southern Belize wanted cruise tourism. The results of the survey are summarized in the following paragraph:</p>
<p>“Based on the exchange of ideas, concerns and viewpoints during the public consultation, the central recommendation of this report is that the government of Belize should not approve a new port of call (port designation), contract or agreement with cruise lines, developers or their affiliates for operations in the Placencia Peninsula. Not only is there widespread resistance to the establishment of cruise tourism in Placencia, as demonstrated by public sentiment, there is also abundant and compelling evidence that communities in the surrounding area are ill prepared for cruise ship arrivals”.</p>
<p>“Monkey River actually voted against that situation, but it's here. We still need that answer from NCL about why are they coming, but they're coming,” said Terry.</p>
<h2 id="a-number-side-to-the-story">A number side to the story</h2>
<p>The first time a cruise ship docked on Belize’s water was in 1991. Ever since, the industry hasn’t stopped growing. The country’s two ports: Fort Street Tourism Village Cruise Port, in Belize City, and Harvest Caye Cruise Port receive thousands of visitors every month, and In each of the past three years, cruise passenger arrivals to Belize has exceeded one million visitors.</p>

<p>Section 4:Rough waters at home</p>
<p>Add quotes from Terry’s wife</p>
<p>Terry’s quotes:<br />
“My wife is one of the first worker to Norwegian Cruise Line,” said Jeremy. “She is a head cook”.</p>
<p>“My wife work for them and the village protested against them. Yeah, she doesn't like it, but she's just one individual compared to the village what could she do. I think [Norwegian] had employee about tree or four girls from the village. Now they still have like two employees. My wife and her cousin that I know off.”</p>
<p>And have you ever worked for the cruise line?<br />
No. [They] have too much rules. My wife does. When I dropped her off, she has to go to a metal detector, drug sniffing dog, and all that before she can go to that island. I always say to her I don't know why she puts up with it but I would never work on an island where every day or every time you come off the island the searching you for drugs or ammunition. I'm not sure what they're looking for. But she likes it. She said they pay a little bit better than the resort,” explained Jeremy.</p>
<p>“A lot of the cruise a lot of the guys that comes off that cruise they don't want to stay in an island they want to go to Placencia or go do an inland tour. [They] want to know where's Belize? Because it's not Belize where they are. They're on a manmade island, a fake Island”.</p>
<p>“[The cruise people] didn't want the workers to interact with the guests. Guests we're asking them how they can get off the island. They didn't want any of that until three or four months time. Guys started asking too much questions so they started putting in some tours to Placencia and some inland tours. But when they first opened the cruise port, it was just for them. They wanted to contain 80% of the guests that come off the cruise to the island or more.” -&gt; relate this to southern Belize’s unemployment rate:<br />
Unemployment rate in 2017:<br />
In Stann Creek District (where Placencia is): 13.1% (the highest of the country)<br />
In Toledo District (where Monkey River is): 3.9%</p>
<p>Unemployment rate in 2018:<br />
In Stann Creek District (where Placencia is): 11.9% (the second highest of the country after Cayo District 13.6%<br />
In Toledo District (where Monkey River is): 6.8% (fourth highest of the country)</p>
<p>It's around 2 p.m. so Terry is back in Placencia to drop off his passengers. Another work day has passed and he's ready to go home and rest, with the hope of not only having given a pleasant tour, but also of having offered something unique. Something only a local guide could offer.</p>
<p>“We know the place. We were born and raised here,” said Terry. I think I can give the guests a different feel, that you lived all your life here and you could give all these little stories. So that might be quite different from someone that never lived here or never been up there [the river].</p>
<p>Like Terry and Jeremy, many of the tour guides in southern Belize know that cruise tourism exists, and nothing is going to change that. But their hope for change remains strong.</p>
