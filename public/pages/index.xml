      <description>Mordy Mis, 26, stands on the shore of Tom Owens Caye, a one-acre island halfway between the shores of Belize and Honduras. On a clear day he can see 25 miles, to the ridgeline of the Maya Mountains, Central America’s highest peaks. Most days, though, he is surrounded only by open ocean, silver and blue waves stretching endlessly in every direction.
In the tidepool at his feet, two nurse sharks, the Carribean’s most docile predators, are circling the carcass of a lionfish.</description>

After traveling hundreds of miles on foot, a group of five Venezuelans, who together call themselves a family, arrived in Medellín on February 27th. Before leaving their homes, they all held different, honest jobs including food service and hair care but were all laid off over the course of the last year due to a crumbling economy. Now in Colombia, the family works 15 hour days asking for money in exchange for small candies on the street in order to make enough money to afford food and a tiny room to sleep in each night.</description>

      <description>Flies swarm at Vincent Budna’s feet as he walks through the piles of rusty paint cans, cardboard boxes and crumpled water bottles.
Smoke slowly wafts skyward from heat-induced trash fires at the edge of the gravel path, burning toxic fumes into the cloudless sky. A flock of vultures perches on top of a mound of fresh garbage, squawking hungrily as they feast on a moldy hunk of bread. A soft ocean breeze blows, and thousands of trash bags flutter in the wind, rippling across the 100-acre property in a wave of black, nonbiodegradable plastic.</description>
