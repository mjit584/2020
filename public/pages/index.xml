      <description>Mordy Mis, 26, stands on the shore of Tom Owens Caye, a one-acre island halfway between the shores of Belize and Honduras. On a clear day he can see 25 miles, to the ridgeline of the Maya Mountains, Central America’s highest peaks. Most days, though, he is surrounded only by open ocean, silver and blue waves stretching endlessly in every direction.
In the tidepool at his feet, two nurse sharks, the Carribean’s most docile predators, are circling the carcass of a lionfish.</description>

      <description>It’s 6 a.m. in Monkey River, a village in southern Belize, and not many people are awake. It’s mostly just roosters and tour guides, who are getting their boats ready to go to Placencia, a tourist destination 40 minutes north of this small, quiet community.
The guides will pick up tourists there and take them back to Monkey River, as they’ve done for at least 20 years.
   Terry Garbutt, a 43-year-old local guide, hops into his 10-passenger boat and leaves the dock.</description>

      <description>Nestled inside the lush green forest of coastal Belize, the dozens of green and red cocoa pods grow.
These pods have been growing in this area since 1800 BC, when the Mayans first discovered they could turn them into a rich drink.
   The pods start out as small white flowers smaller than a pinky finger, and they are pollinated by insects so small they can hardly be seen with the human eye.</description>

      <title>Tide To Trash</title>

      <description>Flies swarm at Vincent Budna’s feet as he walks through the piles of rusty paint cans, cardboard boxes and crumpled water bottles.
Smoke slowly wafts skyward from heat-induced trash fires at the edge of the gravel path, sending toxic fumes into the cloudless sky. A flock of vultures perches on a mound of fresh garbage, squawking eagerly as they feast on a moldy hunk of bread. A soft ocean breeze blows, and trash bags flutter in the wind, rippling across the 100-acre property in a wave of black, nonbiodegradable plastic.</description>

      <description>Lowell “Japs” Godfrey is the king of Little Water Caye.
The small island is 18 miles offshore from the Belizean village of Placencia, and mostly covered in shrubs. Only Godfrey, who boats out to the caye and stays for days or weeks at a time, and a few sea rangers are here. He usually sleeps in a tent under the coconut trees he planted along the shore when he first came to the island several years ago.</description>
