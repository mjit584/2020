    <p>Flies swarm at Vincent Budna’s feet as he walks through the piles of rusty paint cans, cardboard boxes and crumpled water bottles.</p>
<p>Smoke slowly wafts skyward from heat-induced trash fires at the edge of the gravel path, burning toxic fumes into the cloudless sky. A flock of vultures perches on top of a mound of fresh garbage, squawking hungrily as they feast on a moldy hunk of bread. A soft ocean breeze blows, and thousands of trash bags flutter in the wind, rippling across the 100-acre property in a wave of black, nonbiodegradable plastic.</p>
<div id="video-top"></div>

 </div>
<p>Budna glances over at the squawking feeding frenzy, a grin spreading over his face. The birds, Budna explains, are his companions during the long, hot days spent amid the garbage. He sits in his blue plastic chair under a palm frond, waiting for people to come and drop off more bags of trash. Watching for illegal dumping. Taking it all in.</p>
<p>There’s beauty in the dump, and Budna knows this better than anyone. He’s worked as the caretaker of the Placencia Municipal Dump for 14 years, ensuring that the waste from the Placencia peninsula, a narrow strip of land off the southern coast of Belize with a population just shy of 3,500 is handled properly.</p>
<p>In the crowded streets of Placencia, the garbage pits of the dump seem like an eerie memory. Tourists stroll down freshly swept sidewalks, past souvenir shops painted bright pink and yellow, stopping for a meal at one of the many restaurants lining the beach. Tourism is the backbone of the economy, with roughly TKpeople visiting the beach town in TKyear.</p>
<p>But the dump demonstrates the dirty reality of the country’s waste management system. There used to be only six loads of garbage dropped off each week, Budna said. Now, he sees more than 30 loads a week.</p>
<p>The trash in Placencia never really disappears. It’s used to build new land, a practice residents of Seine Bight, a small village five miles north of Placencia, know well. If the garbage makes it to the dump, it will sit in unlined pits, meaning groundwater contamination is likely.  Sometimes, the trash makes its way into the hands of plastic pickers like Radford Cacho, who supports his family by selling bottles. In many areas, there are few resources to support waste removal.</p>
<div class="inner-story-image"><img src="/images/landscape.jpg"></div>
<p>The Belizean government and environmental groups are fighting to reduce the amount of waste generated — but for many residents, new initiatives threaten their economic livelihood.</p>
<p>“Garbage comes from what humans create,” Budna said. “If people don’t want something, they get rid of it. If you have a home, you have papers and wastestuff and food, you have garbage. It does not create itself. It does not come from the nature of this world.”</p>
<h2 id="seine-bight-struggles">Seine Bight Struggles</h2>
<p>There’s only one two-lane road that connects the Placencia Peninsula to mainland Belize. At the neck, down a dirt road marred with potholes, is the Placencia Municipal dump. The tourist town of Placencia sits nearly 20 miles away at the point of the narrow stretch of land. In between lies the Garifuna village of Seine Bight, home to a community of Belizeans who are of mixed African and Caribbean descent.</p>
<p>When Trinell Smith Martinez moved to Seine Bight 18 years ago, the land was all swamp.</p>
<p>Smith Martinez grew up poor. She lived with her family in the town of Dangriga, a cultural center for the Garifuna community in southern Belize. As a child, she prayed: prayed that one day, when she had children of her own, that they wouldn’t experience poverty like she had.</p>
<div class="interactive-section">
<h2>A Lengthy Process</h2>
<img src="../images/yellow-underline-left.svg" class="heading-underline">
<p>Drag the slider to estimate the amount of time to take to decompose</p>

<div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/225947" data-url="https://public.flourish.studio/story/225947/embed"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

</div>
<p>When she heard there were job openings in Seine Bight, the decision was easy. She was going to build her own home, on her own land. She would make a name for herself and her family.</p>
<p>Her newly-procured [size?] land was at the edge of town, where thick groves of mangroves met the Placencia lagoon. The water was knee-deep, she recalled, and they had to wear tall rubber boots to begin constructing her home.</p>
<p>To build the land from the mangrove lagoon, Smith Martinez filled the ground with gravel, sand, and piles of garbage. [what kinds? Could be more descriptive here]</p>
<p>Her current home — a complex of four wooden houses, rebuilt after a devastating fire destroyed everything she owned — is the center of family life for her five children. It symbolizes how hard she’s worked: from a dishwasher at a restaurant to the executive chef at a resort, rising from poverty to homeownership. And it’s built on trash.</p>
<p>TK: explanation of the trash filling process, what’s happening</p>
<p>Walking down the streets of Seine Bight, trash is everywhere. If it’s not filled into the land, it’s everywhere else: the community doesn’t have the means for their waste to regularly be picked up and taken to mak the dump. Instead, there are bottles and take-out boxes floating in the mangrove roots. Yards are full of lumber scraps, gillnets, old car parts and shredded potato chip bags. The charred remains of a garbage fire smolder at the edge of the road, because the only way for many residents to get rid of their waste is to burn it — even though they know the chemicals are major risks to their health.</p>
<div class="photo-card"></div>
<p>“We’re trying not to burn the trash, but at the same time, if that’s the only way at this point to get the waste out of the way, then you’ve got to do what you got to do,” Smith Martinez said. “But we’re trying, you know?”</p>
<p>Kirwin Ramirez, the vice chair of Seine Bight Village, knows that waste management is a major problem. But paying for a garbage truck to come take the waste from the village costs several thousand dollars per month. Right now, the town of 2,000 people doesn’t have the resources.</p>
<p>“Mine is a community that many people look down on,” Ramirez said. “We are the underdogs.  It’s a community full of so much potential and very talented people, but the government does not look at us like that. They look at Placencia more, because that is where the tourists go, that is where they can get more money.”</p>
<p>In Seine Bight, land is gold. Most residents own their homes and everyone wants a piece of property — even if it means building on packed-in trash.</p>

<h2 id="the-dangers-of-the-dump">The dangers of the dump</h2>
<p>Shoes divorced from their mates, toilet paper rolls, empty bottles of sunscreen A dirty bra, with a Pepsi can hanging off of a protruding wire. A microwave.</p>
<p>Budna has watched as the amount of garbage coming in from Placencia steadily increased. As the town and its surrounding villages grow, so do the number of tourists — and the quantity of trash.</p>
<p>“We have more garbage coming in than ever before, and in the next 10 years, we’ll have more garbage than we are facing right at this moment,” Budna said. “We know that there will be a solid impact on our environment. We need to take precautionary measures from now that we will not face that down the line.”</p>
<p>The Placencia Sanitation Company, a private company contracted by the municipal government, collects garbage from residents and businesses twice a week. Individuals pay $22 Belizean a month for garbage collection; businesses pay anywhere from $55 to $250 a month, said Ilsa Villanueva, chairperson of the Placencia Village Council.  The waste is taken to the dump and emptied into a 30-foot pit. When it’s full, the pit is bulldozed over — and the thick jungle foliage quickly reclaims the land.</p>
<p>Belize’s waste management system is about to get a complete overhaul. Within the next year, the Placencia dump will close. Instead, all trash will go to a new $10.2 million transfer station, built on property adjacent to the existing dump. Garbage trucks will drop off their loads at the transfer station and all recyclable materials will be sorted out manually and removed from the facility. The remaining items will be loaded into trailers and hauled to the Regional Sanitary Landfill, a 340-acre property near TKtown.</p>
<p>The new regional site is the country’s only sanitary landfill, meaning it is lined with materials to prevent contamination of groundwater and has mechanisms to collect and treat liquid waste collected from the site.</p>
<div class="inner-story-image"><img src="/images/landscape.jpg"></div>
<p>Unlike the Regional Sanitary Landfill, the pits at Placencia’s current dump are unlined. TK: INTERVIEW WITH A SCIENTIST TO TALK ABOUT ISSUES WITH UNLINED DUMPS, ESPECIALLY AS CLOSE TO THE OCEAN/REEF AS PLACENCIA’S IS.</p>
<p>The transfer station is a step in the right direction, though Budna is concerned it may not be enough.</p>
<p>“I am sure it’s not going to work for what’s coming in the future. They’ll have to expand. But at least for now, it’s going to help us at this time.”</p>
<h2 id="pickers-and-plastic">Pickers and Plastic</h2>
<p>In January, the Belizean government passed legislation to phase out single use plastics, including styrofoam containers, plastic food utensils and shopping bags. By March 2021, the goal is to eliminate all use of the materials, said Seferina Miss, the communications officer at the Southern Environmental Association (SEA) based in Placencia.</p>
<p>TK: A quote from someone about the plastic ban // why it’s necessary</p>
<p>The news came as a devastating blow to the plastic pickers, who come to the dump to sort through the garbage and salvage what they can sell.</p>
<p>In the heat of the early afternoon sun, plastic picker Radford Cacho’s hands move with practiced precision. His neon green shirt is soaked with sweat as he crouches over the garbage bags dropped off that day from homes and businesses in Placencia, but he can’t stop. He needs to find enough bottles to make his 45-minute bicycle commute worth it. He needs to feed his family.</p>
<div class="pull-quote"></div>
<p>He squats lower and tears open the side of the black garbage bag, standing back as food scraps and crumpled wads of paper towel tumble out first. With great speed, he rummages through the bag, throwing aside any plastic or glass bottles he sees. These, he explains, can be sold back to the stores for five and 25 cents, respectively. On a good day, he can make up to $25 Belizean — enough to support his four children and 23 grandchildren.</p>
<p>It’s hard, dirty work. But Cacho’s life is about to get harder. When Belize’s plastic ban is fully phased in, he won’t be able to sort through and find plastic bottles to sell. He’ll lose the majority of his income.</p>
<p>Budna is in a similar situation. He, too, takes plastic and glass bottles that he finds at the dump and brings them back to his home until he has enough to sell back to companies. Without the sale of plastic bottles to supplement his wages, he’ll lose about $3,000 Belizean per month.</p>
<p>The economic repercussions will be felt up and down the peninsula. Restaurants will likely face higher costs to purchase biodegradable or reusable materials, and small business owners will need to find alternatives to the plastics they currently depend on.</p>
<h2 id="the-cycle-starts-anew">The Cycle starts anew</h2>
<p>Kirwin Ramirez hates seeing his community filled with trash. Walking along the sandy gravel streets lined with beer bottles, potato chip bags and old car parts, he calls out to a child walking down the street. He smiles and waves, but his eyes are filled with worry. The sadness in his gaze is unmistakable.</p>
<p>Without more resources, without outside funding, without coordinated educational efforts, there’s not much he can do. He desperately wants to do what’s best for his community, but he knows it will take a complete overhaul of the way resources are allocated to see a real difference.</p>
<p>“People are suffering,” Ramirez said. “If we let the problem beat us down to the ground, we aren’t going to reach anything. We’ve got to find solutions for this problem, because the problem will never end.”</p>
<p>Budna also knows there’s not a real end in sight. He knows the garbage trucks will keep coming, but also that people will continue to dump or burn their waste illegally. But he can’t stop when there’s so much work to be done.</p>
<p>Sometimes, he wants to quit. But he knows if he leaves his job, no one else will take over — there aren’t many people who want to spend their time at the dump, Budna said with a shrug. No one else has the same passion to ensure the world is left a little bit cleaner, a little bit safer for the people of Belize.</p>
<p>“We have all these things that affect the climate in this country and affect the climate of other countries,” Budna said. “I’ve realized garbage is something we have to take care of the right way, to help people understand that garbage has an effect and a deadly impact on each of our lives every day.”</p>
